# Processor Architecture and Computer System Organization Course Materials

## Course Overview

This repository hosts materials for the "Processor Architecture and Computer System Organization" course. It provides a basic understanding of processor architecture and computer system organization, using simple RISC and commercial ARM CPU architectures to explain principles. Topics covered include internal processor architecture, instruction execution, assembly language programming, and interfacing with memory and I/O units.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing this course, students will be able to:
- List the main parts of processors and computers.
- Explain how processors execute instructions.
- Solve simple programming problems in assembly language.
- Explain the interfacing and communication between processor, memory, and I/O units.
- Solve simple problems of communication between processor and I/O units.

## Course Structure

### Lectures
Weekly lectures cover the theoretical foundations of computer architecture and practical programming examples using assembly language.

### Independent Assignments
Students tackle assembly language programming problems individually.

### Laboratory
Practical sessions in a computer architecture simulator where students write, debug, and execute assembly programs.

### Grading Method
- Continuous assessment and exams.
- Laboratory exercises contribute to the grade, alongside midterm and final written exams.

## Week by Week Schedule

- Introduction to computer architecture and data representation.
- Basic organization of the von Neumann machine and assembly language programming.
- I/O and interrupts, including fundamentals and interrupt structures.
- Memory organization, storage systems, and implementation of simple datapaths.
- Final exam covering all course materials.
